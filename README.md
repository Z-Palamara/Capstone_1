Predicting Airbnb Listing Prices

# Project Aim and Background   

Founded in 2008, Airbnb is a growing and popular alternative to traditional lodging. It is essentially an open market where as a host, you can list a spare room, entire apartment or home for prospective travelers to book and use as a domicile during a trip. Currently there are no free resources for hosts to use when trying to price their Airbnb listing on the open market. Since the amount of listings for Airbnb rentals has exploded over the last several years, being able to competitively price your rental space is a must in order to maintain a high booking rate and rate of return for your property. My goal is to develop a tool for hosts to use to gain insight on how to appropriately price their Airbnb rental space in the market they reside in.
